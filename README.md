# AIDL-Problem-Statement-1
This repository contains solution for problem 1 by team- The Ultimates

We have done the pre-processing of the images using python script.
The edges of the bill are detected using the Canny edge detection algorithm and then the image is cropped by using openCV and PIL libraries.
And further we enhanced the cropped image by applying various techniques like adjustment of the contrast etc.

Then we created an android app that is capable of capturing an image and detecting edges,and enhancing the image, which can be customized by the user as per the need.
And then we extracted the text using ML-kit
